# Greedy Method

This method is used for solving optimization problems.

(Optimization Problems - Which requires euther minimum or maximum results.)

Greedy method says that a problem should be solved in stages. In each stage, we will consider an
input from the given problem and if that input is feasible then we will include it in the solution
and by including all the feasible inputs in the solution we will get Optimal solution.
